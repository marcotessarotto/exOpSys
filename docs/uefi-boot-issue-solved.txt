problem:
on my HP 15s-eq2007sl notebook I have installed a new nvme ssd (SAMSUNG 980 PRO 500 GB, MZ-V8P500BW).

On first reboot after installing Debian 11.3 on the new nvme ssd, AMI BIOS reports "no OS manager found", i.e. the pc is not able to boot automatically the new OS. 
It is still possible to boot manually by pressing F9 and selecting manually the position of the efi binary.

The nvme ssd is divided in two partitions, mount command shows:

/dev/nvme0n1p2 on / 
/dev/nvme0n1p2 on /boot/efi type vfat 

The Debian boot loader is installed correctly in /boot/efi/EFI/debian/ directory.

The issue has been solved with the following command (run as superuser):

efibootmgr --create --disk /dev/nvme0n1p1 --loader /EFI/debian/shimx64.efi --label "DEBIAN" --verbose

In this way, the BIOS "sees" correctly an "OS manager" and thus can boot automatically.
